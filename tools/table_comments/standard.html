<h1 id="abotisotopes">ABotIsotopes</h1>
<p>Isotopic values of specific archaeolbotanical plant remains. Typically these are done on a small aggregation of several seeds or samples, so all values are a mean estimate, and the sample size is important to estimate the accuracy and precision of this mean estimate. In contrast, some primary sources instead provide the standard deviations of these values, which is arguably even more important.</p>

<h1 id="abotsamples">ABotSamples</h1>
<p>Records of all taxa. Four columns of PlantPart (1,2,3,4) exist as a convenience for rare occasions where more than one plant part is identified. Overwhelmingly only a single PantPart is required (in PlantPart1) therefore the other three are ussually left blank.

<p>C14 dates in the literature that are missing the minimum required information to be accepted into the C14 table. Their provenance is highly suspicous, yet can be found in some big 14C databases.

<h3 id="labid_1">LabID</h3>
<p>Unique Laboratory identification number. Lab suffixes must be in the C14laboratories table, which end with a hyphen. This is important as labcodes are automatically checked by string splitting on the first hyphen. Note, there are cases where multiple hyphen legitimately exist in a labcode (e.g. OxA-X-2135-46). Other non-standard characters are also permitted, such as ‘.’ or ‘/’. Case sensitivity is important, for example, prefix GD- and Gd- are two different laboratories. Spaces are NOT permitted, therefore rare occasions such as ‘GIF FG 39a’ will be automatically assigned ‘GIFFG-39a’</p>

<h1 id="c14samples">C14Samples</h1>
<p>Ideally 14C dates should be associated with a specific PhaseID which allows them to be directly connected to a multitude of other data. However, most 14C dates can only be secured to a SiteID. The current table 14Cdeadhead will be gradually amalgamated into this table, as data are cleaned and harmonised.</p>
<p>Some C14 samples are assigned to only a SiteID, and others assigned to a PhaseID AND its repective SiteID. Therefore the 14CSamples table uses a composite foreign key to connect to the Phases table.</p>

<h1 id="citations_1">Citations</h1>
<p>Column 1: CitationID is a specific amalgamation of name and year. If Bulatović published as as first author in 2019, this would be designated “bulat2019a”. If another different paper also satisfies this, it is assigned “bulat2019b”. The order of a and b is irrelevant, they are merely to ensure identifiers are unique. Special characters are permitted, to preperly reflect the author’s surname. However, spaces are not permitted, and if absolutely necessary should be replaced with a hyphen (’-’), for example the author ‘Van Neer, Wim’ publishing in 1995  becomes ‘van-n1995a’, and the author ‘Bar-El, Theodora’ publishing in 2000 becomes ‘bar-e2000a’
Columns 2 to 9: match the standard csv output of google scholar.
Columns 10 to 14: information about the type of data in the publication.
There are deliberately no notes fields. If some data needs to reference some specific part of the citation (for example particular pages) this should be done as reference notes in the relevant table. Therefore a citation in this table can be used for multiple data sources.</p>
<p>Databases:
These are not primary sources. Error propagation is a problem when data are harvested by combining existing databases. For example, radiocarbon databases have a ratcheting error problem. This can be combated by ensuring only primary sources are stored.</p>
<p>Theses:
Citing data that has only been published in a thesis should be included in this table. ‘CitationID’ and ‘Author’ and ‘Year’ and ‘Title’ should be specified in the usual way, and ‘Thesis’ can be specified in the ‘Publisher’ field.</p>
<p>Unpublished:
Citations for unpublished sources should be included, since these can be future updated once accepted by journal. Even if the source is in a very preliminary stage, its pre-published ’ownership should be assigned to an individual, therefore the ‘CitationID’ and ‘Author’ and ‘Year’ should be specified in the usual way, and the title  can be used as an optional notes field to provide further details.</p>
<h3 id="citationid_4">CitationID</h3>
<p>Unique identifier of a reference publication, constructed from first five characters of first author’s surname in lowercase (or less if the surname is shorter), year of publication, and a single lowercase letter (a for the first reference, b for the second etc)</p>
<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>

<h1 id="faunalbiometrics">FaunalBiometrics</h1>
<p>The interaction between the ‘Castrate’ probability and ‘Sex’ probability (of being female) is tricky. In cases where the sex determination was originally published as ‘castrate?’ there was uncertainty in the archaeologist’s mind, which we interpret as an equal probability of being castrated or not. However, it is unclear if the archaeologist was confident that it was a male (either castrated or not), or if there was also the possibility that it was female. Therefore, in all cases where the castrate probability is between 0 and 1 we make no judgment on th castrate status and leave null. Likewise where there is no judgement on the sex probability where the castrate status is uncertain.</p>

<h1 id="faunalisotopes">FaunalIsotopes</h1>
<p>Direct isotope values and model parameters from faunal bones and teeth, including Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Sulfur.
Data for individual slices are stored separately in the FaunalIsotopeSequences table. Sometimes only a summary of these data (mean, min max) are available and stored in this table.
Intra-tooth sequential analysis of bioapatite are used to investigate birth seasonality in past animal populations, using a sinusoidal model. Where published, these sinusoidal model parameters are stored in this table.
A sinusoidal model requires four parameters: amplitude (A); period (D); mean (M); delay (φ), such that the output as a function of the distance (d) from the enamel-root junction (ERJ) is: d = A sin(2πd/D + φ) + M.  However, the exact formulation can vary in several ways: 1) It can use either a  sine function or cosine function (with a delay difference of 180 degrees). 2) It can use degrees or radians.  3) The delay can be described in terms of degrees or a proportion of 360 degrees.
For example, Balasse et al 2019 use: A sin(2πd/D + φ) + M, which we hereby describe as ‘model-balasse2019’.
In contrast, Balasse et al 2012 use: A cos(2π (x-x0)/X) + M, where x is identical to d above and where X is identical to D above. Therefore this is equivalent to: A cos(2πd/D + 2πd0/D) + M, from which it can be seen that the delay parameter (d0) in millimetres is used in the term  [ 2 x π x d0/D ] to become radians, doing the equivalent job as φ in the previous formulation. We decribe this model as ‘model-blasse2012’. It is possible for many other formulations to be constructed, therefore it is necessary to specify the model, so that it is clear if the sine or cosine is used, and most importantly, if the delay parameter refers to degrees (φ in model-balasse2019) or millimetres (d0 in model-balasse2012).</p>

<p>This table connects data across more than one table that comes from the same ‘item’. For example, both a radiocarbon date and isotopic values from a single skeleton. An ‘item’ can therefore be at an level of aggregation, such as a bone, artifact or entire context.
All items must by definition be assigned to a site (and may also be assigned to a site-phase) therefore all item IDs should use the SiteID as a prefix, with a three-digit suffix (starting at 101).</p>

<h1 id="phases">Phases</h1>
<p>The phase is the most useful level of aggregation, representing discrete archaeological phases at a site. This is hard to define precisely, but is usually a straightforward matter of defining phases in terms of distinct cultural periods identified in the site reports. Therefore a single phase will typically aggregate data from several ‘contexts’. Sometimes several different site reports exist, and the phasing inconsistencies between them will require the archaeologists inputting the data to make decisions about useful aggregations.</p>
<p>PhaseIDs can be a maximum 9 characters. Do not use special characters or lowercase. Hyphens are OK. Typically the first few refer to the sitename. The last characters (or suffix) therefore specify the phase. Usually this is in terms of a number (1,2,3 etc), letter (A, B, C, etc), period (EN, MN, LN, etc), or culture.</p>
<p>Ideally therefore, all phases should have a cultural assignment. In rare cases, the excavator has assigned two (and in very rare cases three) cultures, perhaps where the phase is considered transitional.  Therefore ‘Culture1’ should always be completed. In the vast maority of cases ‘Culture2’ and ‘Culture3’ should remain NULL, but can accomodate ‘additional’ cultures if required (e.g. transitional between two cultures).  These are not hierarchical - one should not be considered any more likely than another.</p>
<p>The best phase chronology is ‘StartBCEreported’ and EndBCEreported’ which comes from the site report. This will incorporate various sources evidence including subjective expert knowledge of the excavator. However, these are rarely available, so additionally ‘StartBCEestimated’ and ‘EndBCEestimated’ are generated by modelling assoicated radicarbon dates in a phase model. This is an ongoing process that incorporates as priors chronological information from other (local) phases e.g. with the same culture or period.</p>
<p>Dates are reported as BCE, therefore negative values mean AD.</p>
