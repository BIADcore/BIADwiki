# BIAD
## Big Interdisciplinary Archaeological Database
This github repository supports the BIAD wiki [biadwiki.org](http://biadwiki.org/) by providing a single collaborative repository to develop R code for three main purposes:

### 1. R scripts run only by the server
Various internal consistency checks, summary statistics and images are generated automatically from BIAD and used to populate the BIADwiki.
These R scripts are prefaced 'auto.make.xxxxxx.R and run on the hosting server regularly. 
Files prefaced 'auto.make.daily.xxxxx.R' are run each day at 07:15.
Files prefaced 'auto.make.weekly.xxxxx.R' are run once a week. 
A single bash script BIADwiki.sh is run by the crontab schedule. 
BIADwiki.sh invokes R to run a single R script controller.R.
The R script controller.R runs the auto.make.xxx.R scripts.
Login credentials for the local server are stored in the .Rprofile and therefore are automatically invoked when the server runs R in admin.
These scripts will not work if you want to run them externaly from the server as a standard user. To fix this issue it is necessary to first load the functions source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIADwiki/BIADwiki/main/R/functions.R") and to replace the "query.database" function with "run.server.query(query.database(sql.command)".

### 2. General example R scripts for users
All below is now deprecated! don't do that!

Files prefaced 'example.xxxxx.R' are generic example files for end users wishing to interact with BIAD via R, for example when building a script to both query and analyse data.
Get a github account, then clone the whole repository to your local machine to use the scripts. If you want to collaborate with coding (rather than just use it) you will need to request permission to push, from the database administrator.
Credentials are confidential, so you will first (once only) need to create a .Rprofile, and store it in your R_USER folder. You can check which folder this is by running path.expand('~/') in R.

The .Rprofile file (note it only has a dot and file ending, so it it is a hidden file) must contain the following lines which can be obtained fro the database administrator:

user <- 'xxxxx'

password <- 'xxxxx'

hostname <- 'xxxxx'

hostuser <- 'xxxxx'

pempath <-'xxxxx'

These BIAD credentials will now become visible to R from any directory. Any R script should begin with the following line, to first pull some basic R functions from the BIADwiki repo:

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIADwiki/BIADwiki/main/R/functions.R")


### 3. Personal R scipts
Files prefaced 'private.xxxxx.R' in your cloned repository will not be tracked or saved on Github, and will only exist on your machine.

## Future plans

### Automatic phase dating
Work is underway to extend functionality in the R package ADMUR to generate automatic Bayesian phase date estimates.

### Automatic Harris matrix extraction
Plans to extend the ADMUR package to atomatically extract Harris matrices from the phases stored in BIAD
